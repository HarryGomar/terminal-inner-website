Doubts caused by doubts.

I am not defining love. 
From Plato to Fromm, there exists a myriad of attempts to answer the age-old question: “What is love?”. If the great thinkers before me haven’t found agreement, I, with zero years being In Love, seem to be the worst person to give any form of a definite solution. So, instead of outlining my few personal experiences, I will compile my own understanding of the understandings of others. I will attempt to form a structured discussion about my perspective, selfishly stemming from my subjective accounts of other people’s relationships. Some stories come from friends who I respect, others from people I despise, yet I will explore each case knowing the narrative I construct will undoubtedly be partially ignorant. This essay is meant to help me find a solution to my doubts, which implies a certain degree of objective inaccuracy. After all, it is not possible to fully understand someone’s position, as it is likely impossible for another to understand another’s separate opinion on themselves. As this is a personal project I do not wish to partake in a debate regarding the absolute truth of my opinions. That said, I am in no way exempt from criticism, as my biases and lack of information will form incorrect positions in certain situations. Therefore, by writing this essay and one day releasing it I will form better conceptions of the wildly undefined idea of love. 
Before I begin, I must state that I have bastardized the term Simp from its original internet-culture definition. I use the term Simp not to refer to a person who will act with inauthentic niceness to receive sexual benefits, but simply anyone who considers themselves In Love. Additionally, I will not attempt to find a universal conceptualization of any concept, for example being In Love is a term that varies from perspective to perspective.
